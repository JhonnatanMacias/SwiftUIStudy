/*
All three of those are important, but it's the middle one that is doing the heavy lifting: iOS keeps track of every SwiftUI view that reads properties from an @Observed object, so that when a property changes it can intelligently update all the views that depend on it while leaving the others unchanged.

When working with structs, the @State property wrapper keeps a value alive and also watches it for changes. On the other hand, when working with classes, @State is just there for keeping object alive â€“ all the watching for changes and updating the view is taken care of by @Observable.*/
